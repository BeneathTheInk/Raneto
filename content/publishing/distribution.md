### When using Beneath the Ink, what are my distribution options?

Generally, Beneath the Ink acts as the primary distributor for books: we will upload to each of the distribution channels that you purchase (IE iBooks, Kindle, Nook, Kobo) and give you royalty checks monthly or quarterly based on a threshold.

### What is the minimum/maximum amount I sell my eBook for?

We required that all books we distribute be sold for a minimum of $4.99. We generally recommend pricing your eBook around $10, however the best price for an eBook depends on the book and the author. We do not set a maximum price.

### Can I give my book away for free?

The short answer is no. As a royalties dependent company we cannot make any money if you give your book away for free. Keep in mind, however, that many of the distribution platforms, like iBooks, allow you to generate promotional codes to download your book free-of-charge.

If you are interested in giving your book away for free, you may want to learn more about one-time fee pricing. Please contact us for more information.

### Will I receive detailed reports of my book's performance?

Each month, we will email you a report of number of books sold through each of your distribution channels.
