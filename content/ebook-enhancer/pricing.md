Title: How much can I sell my book for?
*/

##### *Note: This question is only applicable to projects with a royalty share: if you are interested in one-time fee pricing please [contact us](mailto:contact@beneaththeink.com).

### Do you have any limitations on what I can charge for the ebook? What is the minimum/maximum allowed?

Minimum is $4.99, we generally recommend somewhere between that and $10 but we don't set a maximum. 

### Can I give my book away for free?

The short answer is no: as a royalties dependent company we don't make any money if you give your book away for free. However, many of the distribution platforms (iBooks, etc) allow for a certain number of free promotional codes: these will be yours to distribute!

Happy Binking!
