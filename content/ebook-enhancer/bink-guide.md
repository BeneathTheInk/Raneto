Title: The Bink Guide

### What is a Bink?

Think about your favorite book, you're reading along and you stumble across the mention of a place, and wish you had a map. Maybe you go and look at an atlas, or more likely, you look online. Then maybe you check your facebook, email, and favorite news site. Next thing you know, it's been 45 minutes, and you've left that book entirely. Your flow is completely interrupted. Binks solve that problem. You get to embed that extra content into the body of the text.

Essentially, a Bink is a container that holds whatever your heart desires; maps, images, audio, video, definitions, footnotes, and author insights. These containers are anchored to a specific word in the text, so that when a reader clicks on that word, they get instant passage to your additional content without even having to leave the page. Unlike a hyperlink, which you may be more  familiar with, Binks do not remove the reader from the book and take them online or to a different location within the text. Binks sit nestled just beneath the ink, waiting to be discovered.

### Best Bink Practices

If you've never read or seen a Beneath the Ink Edition of a book, it can be difficult to imagine where Binks would fit into your own text. Here are some suggestions and best practices to help you make the most of Beneath the Ink's innovative technology.

#### Bink Frequency

When first starting out, it's easy to get over excited and want to put multiple Binks in each paragraph. However, it's important to remember that each Bink requires readers to take a pause, click open a Bink and take a tiny departure from the flow of the paragraph. *We recommend one Bink every 1-3 pages*. At this rate, Binks are frequent enough so that the reader knows what to expect, but still surprising and delightful each time they come across one.

This would be pretty frustrating to try and read.

#### Bink Length

It is so tempting to Bink entire sentences and paragraphs! After all, creating a Bink is as easy as highlighting a word, and what do we do when we highlight? We highlight in bulk! Why choose just one word when you can have them all?

Avoid this impulse!  Binks don't behave like normal text. Because they have special properties, any words that you choose to Bink together will not respond to line breaks like normal words in succession. This means that the body of your text will become a bit of a jumbled mess if you're Binking an entire sentence rather than just a word. Err on the side of caution, and *never make a Bink out of more than two words*. At large font sizes, even three or four words can become very problematic.

#### Bink Content Length

Here, again, it's easy to go overboard. Don't let your excitement get in the way of what is best for your book, after all, you've spent months and possibly years getting your work to the point of completion, and Binks are meant to simply enhance the experience, not overwhelm it. *If you find yourself going into paragraph breaks, you're probably adding too much!* If you've included an image, you probably need no more than a line or two explaining that image.

Always keep in mind the end user experience, if your reader is enjoying the flow of your story, there's a good chance that they won't want to depart from it  for more than a moment or two.

Yikes!

Conversely, don't be too simplistic with your Binks. The last thing you want to do is have somebody open a Bink and feel like it was a waste of time or an unnecessary distraction.

Ultimately, trust your own best judgment- you know which parts of your story demanded deep research or character building, and those are the sections that will lend themselves beautifully to Binks. Never forget that sometimes less is more!
