Title: Who distributes my book?
*/

### Who will be distributing my book?

Generally, Beneath the Ink acts as the primary distributor for books: we will upload to each of the distribution channels that you purchase (IE iBooks, Kindle, Nook , Kobo) and give you royalty checks monthly or quarterly based on a threshold. 

### How do I know how many books I am selling? 

Each month, we will email you a detailed report of number of books sold through each of your distribution channels. 

### Can I distribute my own book?

If you would prefer to distribute your own book, that is certainly a possibility: please [contact us](mailto:contact@beneaththeink.com) to learn more.

Happy Binking!
