Title: I am having manuscript import issues!
*/

### I tried uploading my manuscript via the "import" button, but nothing happened. What now???

Our import tool currently only supports ePub files. If you do not have an ePub file, we can usually make one for you for free: just send your manuscript to alex@beneaththeink.com in an editable format (Word, Rtf, Pages, etc). If you have a more complex eBook and would like a professionally created ePub file, please check out our awesome affiliate [eBook Architects](https://ebookarchitects.com/concourse/get_started.php?refcode=beneaththeink) for a conversion quote!

### I have an ePub file, and it still didn't import: what next?

Sometimes even ePub files fail import (usually because they have some sort of malformed content), if your ePub file isn't importing correctly, please [send us the file directly](mailto:contact@beneaththeink.com) and we will get to the bottom of the problem.

Happy Binking!
