Title: Getting Started
*/

Welcome to eBook Enhancer! This is a quick tutorial to help you import a project and add your first bink. Simply point your browser to [https://alpha.beneaththeink.com](https://alpha.beneaththeink.com) to get started!

### Importing your First Manuscript

Click the `+ New Project` button to create a new project. Give it a revelant title and click `Create`. This will take you to the project interface.

Since this is a brand new project, it doesn't have any content. Clicking `Import your Manuscript` will bring up a file dialog. Select your book from your hard drive and the enhancer will convert it instantly. The eBook Enhancer supports most ePub, Doc and PDF files, however if you are having trouble with import please see our [Import Guide](#).

After your manuscript has imported, the first chapter will be displayed. You can change chapters with the arrows on the keyboard or the toggle buttons on the sides of the screen. To get a glimpse of all the chapters in the book, open the chapter slider (`View` \> `Show Chapters`).

### Highlight to Add Binks

All Beneath the Ink books are powered by [Binks](/ebook-enhancer/bink-guide) and we make it very easy to begin adding them to your content. Simply highlight a word or phrase on the page to bring up the Bink menu. Click the gold `+B` to add a Bink at that location. This will open a bink editting window.

The other buttons on the toolbar allow you to do other things with the selection, like [add characters](#) and [search the project](#).

## Creating and Formatting Bink Content

To add text to a Bink, click the box or just begin typing. When it looks good, click `Save` and the text will be added to the content. Text fields use Markdown for special formatting. Check out the [syntax guide](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [a tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/) to find out more about Markdown.

You can continue to add as many text fields as you need. Drag and drop the fields to rearrange and delete content.

## Adding Media

Files can uploaded to Ehancer through the `Upload File` button in the media sidebar. This will bring up a file dialog to let you choose files from your hard drive. There is also Photobucket API integration, giving you access to small image database to use in your books. To search Photobucket, click the `+` next to `Upload File` and select `Search Photobucket...`.

Once your files have been uploaded, drag and drop them from the sidebar into the Bink content. Just like text fields, media can be rearranged and deleted by dragging.

## Previewing your Work

You can see how your content may look in an actual eBook by enabling preview mode. Select `View` \> `Preview Mode` to turn on. All the Binks in the content will open inline, just like a real book, instead of opening a new window.

To exit preview mode, click `Exit Preview Mode` at the top of the screen.
